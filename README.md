## How to help:

If you're good at code, you can check the [issues page](https://github.com/alfalfascout/pokemon-daycare/issues) for stuff that needs doing, or you could download the source and take a crack at adding a new feature. If you're extra ambitious, you could start a new branch for an earlier generation of pokémon.

If you like to breed pokémon, you can help make sure the statistics are right by hatching a few boxes of pokemon. You can see the tests and comment your results on the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFEstUIAEg4zscSz76uvpAujo8mHS24yrEN2JJe7j-I/edit?usp=sharing).

If you noticed a bug, you can open an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/alfalfascout/pokemon-daycare/issues). Be sure to include what species of pokemon you're working with, what other settings you used, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead.

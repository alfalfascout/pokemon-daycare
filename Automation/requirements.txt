In order to run test, these things need to be installed:

Latest version of python. Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

IMPORTANT: Make sure to add Python to PATH when asked in install

Install an IDE/text editor. I prefer VScode

After Python is installed, open up command prompt and type these commands:
pip install selenium
---Wait until finished---
pip install chromedriver_autoinstaller

When installs are complete, open AutomateTest.py in an IDE and edit the site1 variable
on line 25. Copy the path of index.html in the repo file and paste it into site1.
Or you can paste the actual URl of the website which is http://alfalfascout.github.io/pokemon-daycare/

After this, run the code. All errors will be reported to the log.txt file
